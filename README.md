This repository contains several projects related to real-life applications of AWS Lambda:

1. Setting up a Lambda function that can interface with an AWS RDS database [DONE]
2. Setting up a Lambda function with Kotlin + Maven [WIP]
3. Calling EC2 from Lambda (i.e. lambda function starts an ec2 instance and shuts it down) [DONE]
4. Calling EC2 from Lambda where EC2 is spun up via lambda and lambda exits, then ec2 runs some arbitrary code and shuts down when done processing
5. CICD with Lambda (Github Testing <--> AWS S3 (w. versioning) <--> AWS Lambda)
